- Works offline once loaded
- Fast performance with no network latency

## Technology Stack

- **Framework:** ReactJS with TypeScript
- **Build Tool:** Vite
- **Styling:** Tailwind CSS (with custom Neo-Brutalist theme)
- **Routing:** React Router DOM
- **Code Quality:** ESLint & Prettier
- **Package Manager:** Yarn
- **Core Logic Libraries:**
  - `prettier` (standalone for formatting)
  - `diff` (for text comparison)
  - `react-json-view` (for JSON tree view)
  - `date-fns` (for timestamp/date handling)
  - `cronstrue` and `cron-parser` (for cron expression handling)
  - `crypto-js` (for hash generation)
  - `react-markdown` (for markdown preview)

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/iseif/developer-utility-belt
    cd developer-utility-belt
    ```
2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    yarn
    ```
3.  **Run the development server:**
    ```bash
    yarn dev
    ```
    The application should now be running locally, typically at `http://localhost:5173`.

## Available Scripts

- `yarn dev`: Starts the development server with Hot Module Replacement (HMR)
- `yarn build`: Type-checks the code and creates a production-ready build in the `dist` folder
- `yarn lint`: Runs ESLint to check for code quality issues and potential errors
- `yarn format`: Runs Prettier to automatically format the codebase
- `yarn preview`: Serves the production build locally for previewing
